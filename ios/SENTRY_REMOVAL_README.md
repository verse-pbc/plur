# Sentry Removal Documentation

This README documents the complete removal of Sentry from the iOS app due to compatibility issues with iOS 18.4 SDK and Xcode 16.3.

## Why Sentry Was Removed

Sentry's SDK included C++ code for thread profiling and exception handling that was incompatible with the iOS 18.4 SDK and Xcode 16.3, causing build failures. Specifically:

1. C++ Exception Handling Issues in `SentryCrashMonitor_CPPException.cpp`
2. Thread Profiling Issues in `ThreadMetadataCache.hpp` (incompatible with C++17)
3. Various other C++ compatibility problems

Instead of continuing to patch and workaround these issues, we decided to completely remove Sentry from the iOS app.

## What Was Changed

1. **Podfile Modifications**:
   - Removed the Sentry pod from dependencies
   - Removed all Sentry-specific build configurations 
   - Disabled any remaining C++ exception handling

2. **Flutter Code Changes**:
   - Created a Sentry stub implementation that maintains API compatibility but does nothing
   - Replaced all Sentry imports with references to the stub implementation
   - Disabled Sentry initialization in main.dart

3. **Info.plist Changes**:
   - Added `DisableSentry` flag set to `true`

## How to Verify Removal

To verify that Sentry has been successfully removed:

1. Check that the app builds successfully without C++ errors
2. Verify that no crash reports are sent to Sentry
3. Confirm that app performance is unaffected

## Alternatives for Error Tracking

Without Sentry, consider these alternatives for error tracking:

1. Firebase Crashlytics (already integrated)
2. Custom error logging to server
3. AppCenter Crashes

## Restoring Sentry (If Needed)

If you need to restore Sentry functionality in the future once compatibility issues are resolved:

1. Revert the changes in the Podfile
2. Remove the Sentry stub implementation
3. Restore original Sentry imports in Flutter code
4. Re-enable Sentry initialization in main.dart
5. Update to a compatible version of Sentry that works with iOS 18.4+
