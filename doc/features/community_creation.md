# Community Creation Feature

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the community (group) creation experience in Plur, focusing on the empty state when a user has no communities and how we encourage them to create one.

## Key Components

### Empty State Screen (`NoCommunitiesWidget`)

- Displays when a user has no communities yet
- Shows a visually appealing card with:
  - Community icon
  - Explanation text
  - Prominent "Create Group" button with high contrast
  - Hint about joining via invite links
- Uses consistent dark mode theming to match the app's appearance
- Includes loading indicator during community creation

### Create Community Dialog (`CreateCommunityDialog`)

- Modal dialog that appears when user clicks "Create Group"
- Implemented using `OverlayEntry` to ensure proper theming and prevent double submissions
- Features a clean form with:
  - Community name input
  - Submit button
  - Loading state during creation process
- Creates a new community and transitions to invite sharing screen

### Implementation Details

1. **Theme Consistency**: 
   - Explicit theme overrides to ensure dark mode appearance
   - Uses the app's primary colors for accents
   - White buttons for contrast in dark mode
   
2. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Loading indicators during all creation steps
   - Disabled UI elements during loading to prevent double submissions
   - Clear error handling and recovery
   
3. **Process Flow**:
   1. User sees empty state with "Create Group" button
   2. User clicks button and sees modal with name input
   3. After submission, user sees invitation link they can share
   4. User can then begin posting to their new community

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding community templates or suggestions
- Provide more guidance on community creation best practices
- Add ability to customize community avatar during creation
- Improve invitation sharing options
