# Sentry Removal Documentation

This document explains how and why Sentry was removed from the Plur application.

## Why Sentry Was Removed

Sentry was removed from the Plur application for the following reasons:

1. **iOS SDK Compatibility Issues**: Sentry's C++ code for thread profiling and exception handling was incompatible with iOS 18.4 SDK and Xcode 16.3+.

2. **Build Failures**: The incompatibility issues were causing build failures specifically on iOS and macOS platforms.

3. **Simplification**: Removing Sentry entirely was simpler than maintaining conditional code paths and workarounds.

## What Was Changed

The following changes were made to remove Sentry:

1. **Removed from pubspec.yaml**:
   - Removed `sentry_flutter` dependency
   - Removed `sentry_dart_plugin` dev dependency
   - Removed `sentry` configuration section

2. **File Modifications**:
   - Updated `main.dart` to remove Sentry imports and initialization
   - Replaced Sentry exception capture calls with standard Dart logging
   - Updated SDK files to remove Sentry dependencies

3. **Removed Files**:
   - Moved `sentry_import_helper.dart` to backup
   - Moved `sentry_import_helper_stub.dart` to backup
   - Moved `sentry_stub.dart` to backup

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simplified Builds**: No more need for special handling of Sentry C++ code
2. **iOS Compatibility**: The application now builds properly on iOS 18.4+ with Xcode 16.3+
3. **Reduced Dependencies**: One less external dependency to maintain
4. **Smaller Binary Size**: Removing Sentry reduces the overall application size

## Alternatives Considered

Before completely removing Sentry, the following alternatives were considered:

1. **Patching Sentry C++ Files**: This was attempted but proved to be fragile with each SDK update
2. **Using Conditional Imports**: We tried using platform-specific stubs but this led to inconsistent behavior
3. **Downgrading iOS SDK**: This would have limited our ability to use the latest iOS features

## Future Error Tracking

Error tracking is now handled through basic Dart logging. If more sophisticated error tracking is needed in the future, consider:

1. **Firebase Crashlytics**: More compatible with iOS and easier to integrate
2. **Custom Error Logging**: Implementing a simple error logging system that reports to a custom backend
3. **Re-evaluating Sentry**: If Sentry resolves these compatibility issues in a future version, it could be reconsidered

## Testing

After removing Sentry, the application was successfully built for iOS using:

```bash
eval "$(rbenv init -)"  # Initialize rbenv with Ruby 3.2.2+
flutter clean
flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install
cd ..
flutter build ios --no-codesign
```
