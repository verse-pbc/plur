# Task ID: 41
# Title: Task #41: Redesign Group Information and Administration Pages
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Redesign the group info and admin pages according to the provided design specifications, fix the settings link functionality, improve accessibility of moderation tools, and update the overall UI to match the new design system.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive redesign of the group information and administration pages to improve usability and align with the new design system. Key implementation details include:

1. UI Updates:
   - Implement the new visual design as provided by the designer for all group info and admin pages
   - Update typography, color schemes, spacing, and component styles to match the design system
   - Ensure responsive behavior across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports

2. Settings Link Fix:
   - Debug and repair the broken settings link functionality
   - Ensure proper navigation flow between group settings sections
   - Implement proper state management for settings changes

3. Moderation Tools Enhancement:
   - Reorganize the moderation tools to be more accessible and intuitive
   - Create a dedicated moderation panel with quick-access controls
   - Group related moderation functions together (user management, content moderation, etc.)
   - Add tooltips and help text for moderation features

4. Technical Implementation:
   - Refactor the existing component structure to support the new design
   - Ensure all state management is properly handled
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing data structures
   - Update API calls as needed to support new functionality
   - Implement proper loading states and error handling

5. Accessibility Considerations:
   - Ensure all new UI elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Implement proper keyboard navigation
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Test with screen readers

The implementation should prioritize both visual fidelity to the design and functional improvements to the user experience.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this redesign should be comprehensive and include:

1. Visual Testing:
   - Compare implemented UI against design mockups using visual regression testing tools
   - Verify all UI elements match the design system specifications (colors, typography, spacing)
   - Test responsive behavior across multiple screen sizes and devices
   - Verify dark/light mode implementations if applicable

2. Functional Testing:
   - Verify the settings link works correctly in all navigation contexts
   - Test all moderation tools to ensure they perform their intended functions
   - Validate that all form submissions and state changes persist correctly
   - Test navigation flows between different sections of the group admin interface

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios for common admin tasks and verify they can be completed efficiently
   - Conduct usability testing with a small group of users to gather feedback
   - Verify that moderation tools are more accessible and intuitive than before

4. Accessibility Testing:
   - Run automated accessibility tests using tools like Axe or Lighthouse
   - Perform keyboard navigation testing
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, etc.)
   - Verify color contrast meets WCAG standards

5. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify functionality and appearance in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test on iOS and Android mobile browsers

6. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and compare page load times before and after the redesign
   - Verify that the redesign doesn't introduce performance regressions

Document all test results with screenshots and create a comparison report showing the improvements in both design and functionality.
