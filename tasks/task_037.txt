# Task ID: 37
# Title: Implement Real-Time Group List Updates After Group Information Changes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the application to automatically refresh the main group list when group information (such as icon, name, or other metadata) is updated, ensuring users see the latest changes immediately after returning from the group info page.
# Details:
This task requires implementing a state management solution to ensure group information changes propagate properly throughout the application:

1. Identify all places where group information can be modified (likely in the group info page based on Task #36's context).

2. Implement a state update mechanism that:
   - Captures the updated group information when changes are saved
   - Properly updates the central state store (Redux, Context API, or other state management system in use)
   - Ensures the main group list component subscribes to these state changes

3. Add navigation hooks or callbacks that trigger when a user navigates back from the group info page to the main group list.

4. Implement proper caching strategies to avoid unnecessary API calls:
   - Update local cache with the new group information
   - Consider implementing optimistic UI updates for better user experience

5. Handle edge cases:
   - Account for concurrent updates by multiple users
   - Implement error handling if updates fail to propagate
   - Ensure proper loading states during refresh operations

6. Maintain consistency with the admin-only editing restrictions implemented in Task #36.

7. Consider performance implications, especially for applications with large numbers of groups.

8. Update relevant documentation to reflect the new behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should include:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test state update functions to verify they correctly modify the group information
   - Test navigation hooks/callbacks to ensure they trigger at the right time
   - Test caching mechanisms to confirm proper data storage and retrieval

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify that changes made on the group info page correctly propagate to the group list
   - Test the full navigation flow from group list → group info page → edit information → save → return to group list
   - Verify that the UI updates without requiring manual refresh

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Create automated tests that simulate a user editing group information and returning to the main list
   - Verify visual updates occur as expected (icons, names, etc.)

4. Performance Tests:
   - Measure any performance impact on the main group list rendering
   - Test with a large number of groups to ensure scalability

5. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test behavior when network connectivity is intermittent
   - Test concurrent updates by multiple users
   - Test with various types of group information changes (text only, image only, both, etc.)

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have real users verify the experience feels seamless and intuitive
   - Confirm no additional user actions are required to see updates

7. Regression Testing:
   - Verify that admin-only restrictions from Task #36 still function correctly
   - Ensure other group-related functionality remains intact
