# Task ID: 9
# Title: Anti-spam System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement rate-limits, proof-of-work, and admin moderation tools to prevent spam and abuse.
# Details:
1. Create RateLimiter service:
```typescript
class RateLimiter {
  checkLimit(pubkey: string, action: string): boolean {}
  recordAction(pubkey: string, action: string): void {}
  getActionCount(pubkey: string, action: string, timeWindow: number): number {}
}
```
2. Implement proof-of-work challenge system:
```typescript
class ProofOfWork {
  generateChallenge(difficulty: number): string {}
  verifyProof(challenge: string, proof: string, difficulty: number): boolean {}
  solveChallenge(challenge: string, difficulty: number): string {}
}
```
3. Create moderation tools for admins:
   - Report button on messages
   - Moderation queue UI
   - Ban/mute controls
4. Implement inline flag/report functionality
5. Create moderator queue system
6. Add automated content filtering for known spam patterns
7. Implement graduated rate limits based on user reputation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test rate limiting with rapid action sequences
2. Verify proof-of-work challenge generation and verification
3. Test moderation tools and queue
4. Validate report functionality
5. Test automated content filtering
6. Verify ban/mute controls
7. Performance test with simulated spam attacks
