# Task ID: 48
# Title: Task #48: Refactor main.dart for Improved Maintainability and Adherence to Flutter Best Practices
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Restructure the main.dart file to improve code organization, readability, and maintainability by applying Flutter best practices for large-scale applications, including proper separation of concerns and modular architecture.
# Details:
The refactoring should focus on the following key areas:

1. **Entry Point Simplification**: Reduce the main.dart file to only essential application bootstrapping code.
2. **Widget Tree Organization**: Extract widget trees into separate, logical component files.
3. **Dependency Injection**: Implement a clean dependency injection approach (consider using provider, get_it, or riverpod).
4. **Configuration Management**: Move configuration variables to dedicated config files.
5. **Routing**: Extract routing logic to a dedicated router class/file.
6. **Theme Management**: Move theme definitions to a separate theme file.
7. **State Management**: Ensure state management follows best practices (based on the chosen state management solution).
8. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and global error handling.
9. **Initialization Logic**: Organize app initialization in a clear, sequential manner.
10. **Code Documentation**: Add appropriate documentation for the refactored components.

The refactoring should align with the architectural refactoring plan from Task #47, serving as the first implementation step of that plan. Ensure backward compatibility so that all existing functionality continues to work without regression.

Consider using feature-based folder structure rather than type-based structure for better scalability. For example:
```
lib/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── app.dart (main app widget)
  │   ├── router.dart
  │   └── theme.dart
  ├── features/
  │   ├── feature1/
  │   ├── feature2/
  │   └── ...
  ├── shared/
  │   ├── widgets/
  │   ├── models/
  │   └── utils/
  └── main.dart (minimal entry point)
```

Maintain a changelog of all modifications made to help the team understand the changes.

# Test Strategy:
The refactoring should be verified through the following testing approach:

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Run all existing automated tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring.
   - Manually test all major user flows to verify no functionality has been broken.
   - Verify that the app initializes correctly on different platforms (iOS, Android, web if applicable).

2. **Code Review**:
   - Conduct a thorough code review with at least two senior developers.
   - Use a checklist based on the details section to ensure all aspects were addressed.
   - Verify that the code follows the team's style guide and Flutter best practices.

3. **Static Analysis**:
   - Run Flutter's built-in analyzer with no warnings or errors.
   - Use additional static analysis tools like lint or custom rules to verify code quality.

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure and compare app startup time before and after refactoring.
   - Verify that there's no performance regression in key user journeys.

5. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Ensure all new components and architecture decisions are properly documented.
   - Update any existing documentation that references the old structure.

6. **Incremental Testing**:
   - Consider implementing the refactoring in smaller, testable increments rather than one large change.
   - Create a separate branch for the refactoring and use feature flags if necessary.

7. **Regression Testing**:
   - Run the app on different device sizes to ensure UI renders correctly.
   - Test edge cases like offline mode, low memory conditions, etc.

The task is considered complete when all tests pass, code review is approved, and the application functions identically to the pre-refactored version but with improved code organization and maintainability.
