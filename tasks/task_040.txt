# Task ID: 40
# Title: Task #40: Implement Structured Logging System with Proper Logging Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the application's debugging and logging system to replace ad-hoc print/debugPrint statements with a structured logging approach using a dedicated logging library that supports multiple log levels and filtering capabilities.
# Details:
The implementation should:

1. Select and integrate an appropriate logging library (such as 'logger' package) that supports hierarchical log levels (debug, info, warning, error).

2. Create a centralized logging service/utility class that:
   - Provides consistent methods for logging at different levels
   - Includes context information (class/file name, timestamp, log level)
   - Supports tagging logs by module/component
   - Allows runtime configuration of minimum log level
   - Distinguishes app logs from framework/provider logs

3. Systematically identify and replace all instances of:
   - print()
   - debugPrint()
   - console.log()
   - Any other direct console output methods

4. Update the codebase to use the new logging system:
   - Convert informational prints to logger.info()
   - Convert debugging statements to logger.debug()
   - Convert warnings to logger.warning()
   - Convert error messages to logger.error()

5. Ensure log messages include relevant context:
   - Which component/module generated the log
   - Structured data where appropriate (not just string concatenation)
   - Consistent formatting

6. Add configuration options to:
   - Enable/disable logging to console
   - Set minimum log level for different environments (dev/test/prod)
   - Optionally persist logs for later analysis

7. Document the new logging system for other developers, including:
   - When to use each log level
   - How to add logging to new components
   - How to filter logs during debugging

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the following aspects:

1. Functionality Testing:
   - Verify that logs are correctly generated at each log level
   - Confirm that log filtering works as expected (e.g., setting minimum level to INFO suppresses DEBUG logs)
   - Test that context information is correctly included in log entries

2. Integration Testing:
   - Ensure all components that previously used print/debugPrint now use the logger
   - Verify that logs from different components can be distinguished
   - Test that framework/provider logs are properly separated from app logs

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure the performance impact of the logging system
   - Verify that debug logs don't significantly impact performance in production when disabled

4. Code Review:
   - Perform a comprehensive search for remaining print/debugPrint statements
   - Use static analysis tools to identify any missed direct console outputs
   - Review that log levels are used appropriately (e.g., errors are logged as errors, not as info)

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Verify that developers can easily filter logs during debugging sessions
   - Confirm that logs provide sufficient context to understand application behavior
   - Test that logs are helpful in diagnosing issues

6. Environment Testing:
   - Verify logging behavior in development, testing, and production environments
   - Confirm that sensitive information is not logged in production

7. Documentation Review:
   - Ensure logging guidelines are clear and comprehensive
   - Verify examples are provided for common logging scenarios
