# Task ID: 40
# Title: Task #40: Implement Structured Logging System with Proper Logging Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the application's debugging and logging system to replace ad-hoc print/debugPrint statements with a structured logging approach using a dedicated logging library that supports multiple log levels and filtering capabilities.
# Details:
The implementation should:

1. Select and integrate an appropriate logging library (such as 'logger' package) that supports hierarchical log levels (debug, info, warning, error).

2. Create a centralized logging service/utility class that:
   - Provides consistent methods for logging at different levels
   - Includes context information (class/file name, timestamp, log level)
   - Supports tagging logs by module/component
   - Allows runtime configuration of minimum log level
   - Distinguishes app logs from framework/provider logs

3. Systematically identify and replace all instances of:
   - print()
   - debugPrint()
   - console.log()
   - Any other direct console output methods

4. Update the codebase to use the new logging system:
   - Convert informational prints to logger.info()
   - Convert debugging statements to logger.debug()
   - Convert warnings to logger.warning()
   - Convert error messages to logger.error()

5. Ensure log messages include relevant context:
   - Which component/module generated the log
   - Structured data where appropriate (not just string concatenation)
   - Consistent formatting

6. Add configuration options to:
   - Enable/disable logging to console
   - Set minimum log level for different environments (dev/test/prod)
   - Optionally persist logs for later analysis

7. Document the new logging system for other developers, including:
   - When to use each log level
   - How to add logging to new components
   - How to filter logs during debugging

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the following aspects:

1. Functionality Testing:
   - Verify that logs are correctly generated at each log level
   - Confirm that log filtering works as expected (e.g., setting minimum level to INFO suppresses DEBUG logs)
   - Test that context information is correctly included in log entries

2. Integration Testing:
   - Ensure all components that previously used print/debugPrint now use the logger
   - Verify that logs from different components can be distinguished
   - Test that framework/provider logs are properly separated from app logs

3. Performance Testing:
   - Measure the performance impact of the logging system
   - Verify that debug logs don't significantly impact performance in production when disabled

4. Code Review:
   - Perform a comprehensive search for remaining print/debugPrint statements
   - Use static analysis tools to identify any missed direct console outputs
   - Review that log levels are used appropriately (e.g., errors are logged as errors, not as info)

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Verify that developers can easily filter logs during debugging sessions
   - Confirm that logs provide sufficient context to understand application behavior
   - Test that logs are helpful in diagnosing issues

6. Environment Testing:
   - Verify logging behavior in development, testing, and production environments
   - Confirm that sensitive information is not logged in production

7. Documentation Review:
   - Ensure logging guidelines are clear and comprehensive
   - Verify examples are provided for common logging scenarios

The refactoring of print/debugPrint statements will follow a structured approach based on the categories of logs identified in the codebase:

1. Log Level Mapping:
   - Debug/Development logs → logger.d()
   - Error logs → logger.e() (already implemented in error_logger.dart)
   - Important state changes and user interactions → logger.i()
   - Verbose debugging (network/API calls) → logger.v()
   - Warnings and potential issues → logger.w()

2. Priority Files for Refactoring:
   - lib/router/group/* (contains highest concentration of debug prints)
   - lib/provider/* (state management logging)
   - lib/component/styled_bot_toast.dart
   - lib/features/asks_offers/providers/listing_provider.dart
   - UI widgets with rebuild logging

3. Implementation Guidelines:
   - Ensure performance logging is conditionally executed only in debug mode
   - Standardize log message formatting across the application
   - Add contextual information to log messages where appropriate
   - Remove redundant or excessive logging statements
   - Maintain compatibility with the global logger instance set up in the previous subtask

4. Progress Tracking:
   - Starting with group-related files as they contain the most logging statements
   - Will proceed with providers next
   - UI components will be addressed last

This refactoring will prepare the codebase for the next subtask of removing old print/debugPrint statements entirely.

## 4. Remove old print/debugPrint statements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all old print and debugPrint statements are removed or commented out after refactoring to use the logger.
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-17T09:57:04.701Z>
Initial analysis of print/debugPrint statements that need to be removed:

1. Found numerous files still containing:
   - dart:developer imports (60+ files)
   - debugPrint statements (40+ files)
   - print statements (several files)

2. Key files requiring refactoring:
   - lib/data/group_read_info_db.dart (multiple debugPrint statements)
   - lib/util/group_id_util.dart (multiple debugPrint statements)
   - lib/router/group/* files (many debugPrint statements)
   - lib/features/events/* (many debugPrint statements in models and providers)
   - lib/features/asks_offers/* (multiple debugPrint statements)

3. Approach for removal:
   - Replace all debugPrint statements with appropriate logger calls
   - Remove dart:developer imports that are no longer needed
   - For any commented print statements, either remove them or convert to logger.d() calls
   - Pay special attention to error logging to ensure proper context is maintained

4. Priority files:
   - First focus on data access and provider classes as they're core to application functionality
   - Then handle UI component and routing files
   - Finally address specialized features like events and asks/offers

This task will require systematic work through the codebase, replacing each instance with the appropriate logger call.

Progress update on removing old print/debugPrint statements:

1. Files updated:
   - lib/data/group_read_info_db.dart - Replaced all debugPrint statements with logger.e() calls for error logging
   - lib/util/group_id_util.dart - Replaced debugPrint statements with logger.d() calls, added kDebugMode check for performance optimization

2. Improvements made:
   - Error logging now includes proper error objects (passed as second parameter to logger.e())
   - Debug logging now wrapped in kDebugMode checks to prevent running in production
   - Used appropriate log levels (debug for diagnostic information, error for exceptions)
   - Fixed return logic in group_id_util.dart to ensure proper function behavior regardless of debug mode

3. Next files to update:
   - Continue with other database access classes
   - Move on to provider classes (e.g., group_provider.dart, user_provider.dart)
   - Update UI/routing files in lib/router/group/
   - Refactor event logging in lib/features/events/

This systematic approach ensures all legacy debugging statements are properly migrated to the new structured logging system while maintaining the same level of diagnostic information.

   - lib/data/dm_session_info_db.dart - Replaced print statement with logger.w() call for warning conditions
   - lib/features/events/models/event_model.dart - Comprehensively refactored with proper log levels and performance considerations
   
2. Improvements made during refactoring:
   - Added conditional logging with kDebugMode checks to prevent unnecessary string concatenation in production
   - Used appropriate log levels based on context (debug, warning, error)
   - Improved error logging to include stack traces where available
   - Made code more maintainable by ensuring log operations don't affect normal code flow
   - Added conditional branches to ensure tag processing works correctly even when logging is disabled

3. Pattern established for event logging:
   - Use logger.d() for development-only debugging information (inside kDebugMode checks)
   - Use logger.w() for parsing errors that can be recovered from
   - Use logger.e() for critical errors that trigger a rethrow, include stack trace when available

4. Next steps:
   - Continue with the remaining files in features/events directory
   - Address group-related files in router/group
   - Tackle community features and listings
   - Focus on UI component files where logs are used for debugging rebuilds

This systematic approach is approximately 15% complete. The established patterns are ensuring consistent logging across the codebase.

## 5. (Optional) Add log filtering and custom output [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the logger to support log filtering by level or tag, and optionally output logs to a file or remote server.
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-17T10:07:20.110Z>
The log filtering system has been enhanced with the following features:

1. Category-based filtering system:
   - Created an enum `LogCategory` with standard categories (core, network, database, UI, auth, groups, events, performance)
   - Implemented filter methods to include/exclude specific categories
   - Enhanced log methods to accept an optional category parameter with a default of 'core'
   - Added category display in log output ('[category] message')
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing log calls

2. Tag-based filtering:
   - Converted static exclusion list to a dynamic set of tags
   - Added methods to add/remove excluded tags at runtime
   - Optimized filtering logic to check messages against excluded tags
   - Included default tags for noisy components (provider, navigator)

3. Debug override functionality:
   - Implemented a debug override flag that can be toggled at runtime
   - When enabled, it shows all logs regardless of other filters
   - Helpful for troubleshooting specific issues temporarily

4. Runtime configuration UI:
   - Added `LogFilterDialog` to allow changing filter settings at runtime
   - Implemented UI for toggling categories, adding/removing tags, and enabling debug override
   - Added a reset button to clear all filters
   - Made the dialog accessible via a static method for easy integration

5. Performance optimizations:
   - Added early returns in log methods to avoid unnecessary string formatting
   - Optimized tag filtering with lowercase comparison
   - Maintained production safeguards to ensure errors and warnings are always logged

These enhancements provide fine-grained control over the logging system, making it easier to focus on specific areas of the application during debugging while reducing noise from unrelated components.

### Description: Test the app to ensure only structured logs appear, log levels work, and filtering is effective.
### Details:


## 8. (Optional) Add CI/pre-commit hook for print/debugPrint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add a lint rule or script to catch stray print/debugPrint calls in PRs or before commits.
### Details:


## 9. Configure logger to remove stack trace headers from log output [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the logger configuration to remove the verbose function call stack traces (#0, #1, etc.) that appear before each log message, making logs cleaner and more readable.
### Details:
Update the PrettyPrinter configuration in app_logger.dart to suppress or significantly reduce the stack trace information shown with each log message. The goal is to make log output cleaner and more focused on the actual message content rather than implementation details.
<info added on 2025-05-17T10:02:07.684Z>
Update the PrettyPrinter configuration in app_logger.dart to suppress or significantly reduce the stack trace information shown with each log message. The goal is to make log output cleaner and more focused on the actual message content rather than implementation details.

The current logger implementation displays unhelpful internal stack traces with each log message (e.g., '#0 package:logger/src/printers/pretty_printer.dart', '#1 package:logger/src/logger.dart') rather than showing the actual application code that triggered the log. This creates several issues:

1. Noise: Adds 2+ lines of irrelevant information before each log message
2. Unhelpfulness: Doesn't show where in our application code the log was triggered from
3. Distraction: Makes it harder to scan logs for important information

To resolve this issue:
- Modify the PrettyPrinter configuration to either completely disable stack trace output for normal logs
- Or configure it to show only relevant application code stack frames (filtering out the logger's internal frames)
- Consider implementing a custom LogPrinter that formats logs in a cleaner way, such as: "11:47:07.970 [INFO] ErrorLogger initialized successfully"
- If stack traces are needed for debugging purposes, ensure they show the actual application code that called the logger, not the logger's internal implementation

Look for configuration options like 'methodCount', 'stackTraceBeginIndex', or similar parameters in the PrettyPrinter class that control stack trace display behavior.
