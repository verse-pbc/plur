# Task ID: 45
# Title: Task #45: Implement User Content Self-Management and Account Deletion Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality that allows users to remove all their content from groups, delete their posts from the nostrverse, and broadcast deletion messages when they choose to delete their account.
# Details:
This task involves creating a comprehensive content management system for users to have greater control over their data:

1. Group Content Removal:
   - Add a new option in the user's group settings to "Remove all my content from this group"
   - Implement backend logic to identify and remove all user-created content within a specific group
   - Include confirmation dialogs with clear warnings about the permanence of this action
   - Ensure proper permissions checks to prevent unauthorized content removal

2. Global Content Deletion:
   - Create a new section in user settings called "Content Management"
   - Implement functionality to allow users to delete all their posts across the entire nostrverse
   - Include options for selective deletion (by date range, by group, etc.)
   - Add appropriate confirmation steps to prevent accidental deletion

3. Individual Post Management:
   - Enhance the post UI with more visible delete options for users' own posts
   - Implement proper cascading deletion for comments and reactions
   - Add confirmation dialogs for post deletion

4. Account Deletion Process:
   - Create a comprehensive account deletion workflow in user settings
   - Implement the broadcasting of deletion messages to the network when an account is deleted
   - Ensure all deletion events are properly signed and propagated through the nostr protocol
   - Add a grace period option where account deletion can be reversed within a set timeframe

5. Database and Storage Considerations:
   - Update database schemas if needed to support these deletion operations
   - Implement efficient queries to handle potentially large deletion operations
   - Consider implementing soft deletes where appropriate for recovery options

6. UI/UX Design:
   - Design clear, intuitive interfaces for these deletion features
   - Include appropriate warnings and confirmation steps
   - Provide feedback on deletion progress for large operations

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of content deletion:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test individual deletion functions for posts, comments, and user data
   - Verify proper error handling for failed deletions
   - Test permission validation to ensure users can only delete their own content

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify that deletion operations properly cascade to related content
   - Test the broadcast mechanism for deletion messages
   - Ensure deletion events are properly propagated through the nostr network
   - Verify database integrity after deletion operations

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test accounts with substantial content across multiple groups
   - Perform group-specific content removal and verify only targeted content is removed
   - Test global content deletion and verify all user content is properly removed
   - Test account deletion and verify all appropriate deletion messages are broadcast

4. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test deletion operations with very large amounts of content
   - Verify behavior when network connectivity is intermittent
   - Test concurrent deletion operations
   - Verify system behavior when deletion operations are interrupted

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize performance for large deletion operations
   - Test server load during multiple simultaneous deletion operations

6. Security Testing:
   - Verify that users cannot delete content they don't own
   - Test for potential race conditions or security vulnerabilities in the deletion process

7. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify all confirmation dialogs are clear and functional
   - Test progress indicators for long-running deletion operations
   - Ensure error messages are helpful and user-friendly
