# Task ID: 49
# Title: Task #49: Implement Nostr Provider Pattern for Centralized SDK Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extract the Nostr library and SDK into a provider pattern implementation to centralize its management and eliminate redundant instantiations throughout the application.
# Details:
This task involves refactoring the current implementation of Nostr functionality across the app to follow a provider pattern:

1. Create a dedicated NostrProvider class that will be responsible for:
   - Initializing the Nostr SDK once
   - Managing connection state
   - Providing access to Nostr functionality through a clean API

2. Implement dependency injection for the NostrProvider:
   - Use a service locator pattern (like get_it) or Provider package
   - Ensure the provider is initialized early in the application lifecycle
   - Configure proper scoping (singleton is likely appropriate)

3. Refactor existing code:
   - Identify all locations where Nostr SDK is currently instantiated
   - Replace direct instantiations with references to the centralized provider
   - Update all Nostr-related function calls to use the provider's methods
   - Ensure proper error handling and state management

4. Optimize the provider implementation:
   - Add connection pooling if applicable
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Add logging for debugging purposes
   - Consider implementing retry logic for failed operations

5. Update documentation:
   - Document the new provider pattern
   - Add usage examples for other developers
   - Update any existing documentation that references direct Nostr SDK usage

This refactoring will improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, centralize configuration, and potentially improve performance by eliminating redundant connections and operations.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality of the NostrProvider and the successful integration across the application:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the NostrProvider class in isolation
   - Verify initialization, connection management, and API methods
   - Mock the underlying Nostr SDK to test error handling and edge cases
   - Test caching and optimization strategies

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify that all components using Nostr functionality continue to work correctly
   - Test the application under various network conditions
   - Ensure proper resource cleanup and connection management
   - Verify no memory leaks occur with long-running operations

3. Performance Testing:
   - Compare application performance before and after the refactoring
   - Measure connection establishment times
   - Monitor memory usage to confirm reduced resource consumption
   - Test under high load to ensure stability

4. Code Review Verification:
   - Conduct a thorough code review to ensure no direct instantiations remain
   - Verify consistent usage of the provider pattern throughout the codebase
   - Check for proper error handling in all consumer code

5. Manual Testing Checklist:
   - Test all features that rely on Nostr functionality
   - Verify application behavior during network interruptions
   - Test application startup and shutdown to ensure proper initialization and cleanup
   - Verify that all existing functionality works as expected after the refactoring

The task can be considered complete when all tests pass, no direct Nostr SDK instantiations remain in the codebase, and all Nostr-related functionality works correctly through the new provider.
