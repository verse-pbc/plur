# Task ID: 43
# Title: Task #43: Conditionally Display Zap Icons Based on NWC Wallet Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the application to only display zap icons when the user has successfully set up a Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) wallet, hiding this functionality from users without a configured wallet.
# Details:
This task requires modifying the UI components that display zap icons throughout the application to make them conditional on the user's wallet status. Implementation steps include:

1. Identify all locations where zap icons are currently displayed in the UI (posts, comments, profiles, etc.)
2. Create or modify the existing wallet status check functionality to reliably determine if a user has set up an NWC wallet
3. Implement a conditional rendering mechanism that checks the wallet status before displaying zap icons
4. Update the relevant components to use this conditional logic
5. Ensure the UI gracefully handles the absence of zap icons without creating layout issues
6. Consider adding a tooltip or small notification that explains why zap icons aren't visible for users without a wallet
7. Update any related documentation to explain this conditional behavior
8. Ensure the wallet status check is efficient and doesn't cause performance issues, especially on pages with multiple zap icons

The implementation should maintain a consistent user experience while clearly indicating the relationship between wallet setup and zapping functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify that zap icons appear and function correctly only when appropriate:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test the wallet status detection function with various wallet states
   - Verify conditional rendering logic in isolation
   - Test UI components with and without wallet configuration

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify that zap icons are hidden when no NWC wallet is configured
   - Confirm zap icons appear when a valid NWC wallet is set up
   - Test the transition between these states (setting up a wallet should make icons appear)

3. End-to-end tests:
   - Complete user flows with and without wallet setup
   - Verify all pages maintain proper layout regardless of zap icon visibility

4. Manual testing:
   - Test on multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure responsive design isn't broken
   - Verify that adding a wallet immediately updates the UI to show zap icons without requiring a page refresh
   - Test edge cases like disconnecting a wallet to ensure icons disappear appropriately

5. Accessibility testing:
   - Ensure any tooltips or explanatory elements are accessible
   - Verify that the conditional display doesn't affect screen reader functionality

Document all test cases and results, including screenshots of the UI both with and without zap icons visible.
