# Task ID: 13
# Title: Project Setup and Repository Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React 18, Vite, TailwindCSS 3, and configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Vercel deployment.
# Details:
1. Create a new GitHub repository for holis.social
2. Initialize a React 18 project with Vite
3. Configure TailwindCSS 3
4. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
5. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
6. Set up Vercel project and link to repository
7. Create development, staging, and production environments
8. Add README with project overview and setup instructions

Example package.json:
```json
{
  "name": "holis-social",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.0.0",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.14",
    "eslint": "^8.38.0",
    "postcss": "^8.4.23",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.2",
    "vite": "^4.3.9"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext js,jsx --report-unused-disable-directives",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the repository is correctly initialized with all dependencies
2. Ensure CI/CD pipeline successfully builds the project
3. Confirm that Vercel preview deployments work correctly
4. Test that the development environment can be set up with a single command
