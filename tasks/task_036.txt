# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Admin-Only Group Information Editing Restrictions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the group management system to restrict editing of group information exclusively to users with admin privileges, and implement appropriate UI feedback for non-admin users.
# Details:
This task requires implementing permission-based access control for group information editing across both frontend and backend systems:

1. Backend Implementation:
   - Modify the group information API endpoints to verify admin privileges before processing edit requests
   - Add middleware that checks user roles/permissions before allowing access to group editing functionality
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (403 Forbidden) when non-admin users attempt to modify group data
   - Ensure all group information update routes are protected with the admin permission check
   - Log unauthorized access attempts for security monitoring

2. Frontend Implementation:
   - Update the group information UI components to conditionally render edit buttons/forms only for admin users
   - Add visual indicators that clearly communicate editing restrictions to non-admin users
   - Implement informative tooltips explaining that admin privileges are required for editing
   - Ensure that direct API calls from the frontend always include permission checks
   - Add graceful error handling for cases where permissions change during a user session

3. User Experience Considerations:
   - Design clear feedback messages that explain why editing is restricted
   - Consider implementing a "Request Changes" feature for non-admin users to suggest edits
   - Ensure the UI remains intuitive by not showing edit options that users cannot access
   - Maintain consistent permission models across web and mobile applications

4. Security Considerations:
   - Implement both client-side and server-side validation to prevent permission bypassing
   - Ensure that all group editing API endpoints have consistent permission checks
   - Consider adding rate limiting for failed edit attempts to prevent brute force attacks

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should verify both the technical implementation and user experience aspects:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the permission checking middleware with various user roles
   - Verify that all group editing API endpoints correctly enforce admin permissions
   - Test error handling for unauthorized access attempts

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify that the frontend correctly displays/hides edit functionality based on user role
   - Test the complete flow of group information editing for both admin and non-admin users
   - Ensure proper error messages are displayed when permission checks fail

3. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create test scenarios with different user types attempting to edit group information
   - Verify that admin users can successfully edit all group information
   - Confirm that non-admin users receive clear feedback when attempting to access edit functionality
   - Test across different devices and screen sizes to ensure consistent behavior

4. Security Testing:
   - Attempt to bypass permissions using direct API calls
   - Test with manipulated request payloads to ensure server-side validation is robust
   - Verify that session timeout/expiration correctly revokes editing capabilities

5. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure that existing group viewing functionality works correctly for all users
   - Verify that other group-related features (joining, leaving, etc.) are unaffected
   - Test across both web and native applications to ensure consistent behavior

6. Documentation Verification:
   - Confirm that user documentation clearly explains the permission model
   - Verify that API documentation accurately reflects the permission requirements
