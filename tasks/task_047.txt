# Title: Task #47: Develop Incremental Architectural Refactoring Plan for Flutter Application
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive, step-by-step refactoring plan to address major architectural issues in the Flutter codebase, focusing on modularization, dependency management, routing, state handling, and code maintainability.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current codebase to identify all areas of excessive coupling, especially in main.dart, and document the current import, state, and routing patterns.
2. Define clear feature modules with explicit boundaries, ensuring each module encapsulates its own views, view models, repositories, and services, following MVVM or a similar layered architecture as recommended by Flutter best practices[1][2].
3. Design and implement a robust dependency injection system (e.g., using get_it or riverpod), replacing direct dependency access and singleton initializations with injected dependencies to improve testability and maintainability[1][2].
4. Refactor the router architecture by extracting route definitions from main.dart and organizing them into dedicated routing modules, ensuring separation from application initialization logic.
5. Break down global state and singleton objects into coherent, modular state management units, leveraging providers or other state management solutions declaratively rather than imperatively[1][2].
6. Introduce barrel files (index.dart) for each module to aggregate exports and reduce import clutter throughout the codebase.
7. Establish and document clear layering (data, domain, presentation) within each module, ensuring responsibilities are well-separated and interfaces are well-defined[1][2][4].
8. Convert imperative provider initialization to a declarative approach, utilizing MultiProvider or similar patterns for cleaner and more maintainable state management.
9. Throughout the refactoring, monitor and address any performance regressions, applying Flutter performance best practices as needed[5].
10. Structure the plan for incremental implementation, prioritizing non-breaking changes and providing migration guidance for each step to ensure application stability.

# Test Strategy:
- Review the refactoring plan for completeness, clarity, and adherence to Flutter architectural best practices.
- Verify that main.dart is reduced to minimal imports and contains only application bootstrap logic.
- Confirm that all feature modules have clear boundaries, barrel files, and follow the prescribed layering (data, domain, presentation).
- Ensure all dependencies are injected rather than accessed directly or via singletons.
- Check that routing logic is fully separated from initialization and is modularized.
- Validate that global state is broken into coherent modules and initialized declaratively.
- Run the full test suite after each incremental refactoring step to ensure no regressions or breaking changes.
- Profile application performance before and after refactoring to confirm no new bottlenecks are introduced.
- Conduct code reviews to ensure maintainability, readability, and adherence to the new architecture.
