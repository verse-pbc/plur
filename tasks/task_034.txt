# Task ID: 34
# Title: Setup Cashu Wallet Integration for New User Accounts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement automatic Cashu wallet creation for each new user account registered on the Holis platform, enabling users to immediately participate in financial transactions within the application ecosystem.
# Details:
This task involves integrating the Cashu protocol for creating and managing digital wallets for all new user accounts on the Holis platform. Implementation details include:

1. Research and understand the Cashu protocol specifications and API documentation.
2. Set up a Cashu mint connection or integration with an existing mint service.
3. Create a wallet service module that will:
   - Generate a new Cashu wallet when a user account is created
   - Store wallet information securely in the user's profile database
   - Handle wallet initialization and key management
   - Implement proper error handling for failed wallet creation
4. Modify the user registration flow to trigger wallet creation after successful account creation
5. Implement wallet recovery mechanisms in case of data loss
6. Add logging for wallet creation events for auditing and debugging purposes
7. Create admin dashboard components to monitor wallet creation status
8. Ensure compliance with relevant financial regulations regarding digital wallets
9. Implement proper security measures to protect wallet credentials and private keys
10. Document the wallet creation process for both technical and non-technical stakeholders
11. Consider scalability aspects as the user base grows

The implementation should be done with the Oslo Freedom Forum milestone in mind, ensuring that the wallet functionality meets the specific requirements of event participants.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for the Cashu wallet integration should be comprehensive and include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test wallet creation service in isolation
   - Verify proper error handling for various failure scenarios
   - Test wallet data storage and retrieval functions

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify that wallet creation is triggered correctly during user registration
   - Test the integration between the application and the Cashu protocol
   - Ensure wallet information is properly stored in the user database

3. End-to-end tests:
   - Complete user registration flow and verify wallet creation
   - Test wallet functionality after creation (e.g., receiving funds)
   - Verify wallet recovery mechanisms

4. Security testing:
   - Penetration testing focused on wallet credentials protection
   - Verify that wallet private keys are properly secured
   - Test for potential vulnerabilities in the wallet creation process

5. Performance testing:
   - Measure the impact of wallet creation on user registration time
   - Test wallet creation under load (multiple simultaneous registrations)

6. Manual testing:
   - Create test accounts and verify wallet creation through admin dashboard
   - Verify wallet functionality from user perspective
   - Test on different devices and network conditions

7. Acceptance criteria verification:
   - Every new user account must have an associated Cashu wallet
   - Wallet creation must be automatic and require no user intervention
   - Wallet details must be securely stored and accessible to the user
   - The system must handle wallet creation failures gracefully

Document all test results and fix any issues before considering the task complete.
