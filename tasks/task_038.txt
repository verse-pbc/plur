# Task ID: 38
# Title: Task #38: Disable Broadcast Option for Group-Contained Posts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the post creation interface to automatically disable and hide the broadcast option when a user is creating a post within a group context, ensuring group posts remain contained within their intended audience.
# Details:
This task requires modifying the post creation component to be context-aware of its environment (whether it's being created within a group or not). Implementation details include:

1. Update the post creation component to receive and check the current context (group ID or null).
2. When a post is being created within a group context (group ID is present):
   - Hide the broadcast toggle/option from the UI
   - Set the default broadcast value to false
   - Disable any programmatic attempts to enable broadcasting
3. Ensure the backend validation also enforces this rule by rejecting any attempts to broadcast posts that have a group ID associated with them
4. Update the post schema/model if necessary to clarify the relationship between group membership and broadcast capabilities
5. Add appropriate tooltips or helper text explaining why broadcast is unavailable when posting in groups
6. Consider edge cases such as:
   - What happens if a user starts creating a post outside a group and then navigates into a group context
   - How drafts should behave when moved between contexts
   - Whether existing posts in groups that were somehow broadcasted should be retroactively modified

The implementation should maintain a clean user experience while enforcing the business rule that group posts should remain within their group context.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the UI behavior and backend enforcement:

1. UI Testing:
   - Verify the broadcast option is visible when creating posts outside of groups
   - Verify the broadcast option is hidden when creating posts inside a group
   - Test transitioning between contexts (if applicable) to ensure proper UI updates
   - Verify appropriate helper text or tooltips are displayed

2. Functional Testing:
   - Create a post within a group and verify it cannot be broadcasted
   - Attempt to programmatically enable broadcasting for a group post (via API or direct calls) and verify it fails
   - Verify posts created outside groups can still be broadcasted normally

3. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test with different user permission levels to ensure consistent behavior
   - Test with draft posts moved between contexts
   - Test with various group types/configurations

4. Regression Testing:
   - Verify existing functionality for non-group posts remains unchanged
   - Ensure group visibility and permissions still work correctly

5. API Testing:
   - Verify the API rejects attempts to broadcast group posts
   - Test error messages and status codes for invalid broadcast attempts

6. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have group admins verify the experience matches expectations
   - Confirm the UI changes are intuitive and don't confuse users
