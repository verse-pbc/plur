# Title: Task #42: Update Site Terminology from "Admin" to "Organizer"
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the site's terminology to replace all instances of "admin" with "organizer" throughout the user interface, database references, and documentation to better reflect the collaborative nature of group management.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive terminology update across the entire platform:

1. UI Components:
   - Identify and update all UI text, labels, buttons, and tooltips that use "admin" terminology
   - Update navigation menu items and breadcrumbs
   - Modify form labels and placeholder text
   - Update error messages and confirmation dialogs
   - Revise help text and contextual guidance

2. Code Changes:
   - Refactor variable names, function names, and comments in the codebase
   - Update CSS class names that reference "admin" (e.g., .admin-panel → .organizer-panel)
   - Modify component and module names as appropriate
   - Update route names and URL paths (e.g., /admin/settings → /organizer/settings)

3. Database:
   - Update database field names if necessary (create migration scripts)
   - Modify stored procedures or queries that reference admin terminology
   - Update any role-based access control (RBAC) definitions

4. Documentation:
   - Update user documentation, help guides, and tooltips
   - Revise developer documentation and API references
   - Update any training materials or onboarding guides

5. Considerations:
   - Maintain backward compatibility where necessary
   - Ensure the changes are consistent across all parts of the application
   - Consider implementing redirects for any changed URLs to prevent broken links
   - Update any email templates or notifications that use "admin" terminology
   - Ensure translations are updated for all supported languages

# Test Strategy:
1. Automated Testing:
   - Update existing unit tests to reflect the new terminology
   - Create new tests to verify that all "admin" references have been properly replaced
   - Run regression tests to ensure functionality remains intact
   - Implement UI tests to verify visual elements display "organizer" correctly

2. Manual Testing:
   - Perform a comprehensive UI review to identify any missed instances of "admin" terminology
   - Test all user flows related to organizer functionality
   - Verify that all tooltips, error messages, and help text use the correct terminology
   - Check that URL changes and redirects work properly
   - Test the application in all supported languages to ensure translations are correct

3. Database Verification:
   - Verify that database migrations executed correctly
   - Confirm that queries using the new terminology return the expected results
   - Test that role-based permissions work correctly with the updated terminology

4. Documentation Review:
   - Review all documentation to ensure consistent use of "organizer" terminology
   - Verify that screenshots in documentation reflect the updated UI
   - Check that API documentation uses the correct terminology

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have stakeholders review the changes to confirm the terminology update meets requirements
   - Collect feedback from a small group of users before full deployment
   - Monitor support requests after deployment for any confusion related to the terminology change
