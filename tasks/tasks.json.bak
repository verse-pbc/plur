The goal is to make log output cleaner and more focused on the actual message content rather than implementation details.\n\nThe current logger implementation displays unhelpful internal stack traces with each log message (e.g., '#0 package:logger/src/printers/pretty_printer.dart', '#1 package:logger/src/logger.dart') rather than showing the actual application code that triggered the log. This creates several issues:\n\n1. Noise: Adds 2+ lines of irrelevant information before each log message\n2. Unhelpfulness: Doesn't show where in our application code the log was triggered from\n3. Distraction: Makes it harder to scan logs for important information\n\nTo resolve this issue:\n- Modify the PrettyPrinter configuration to either completely disable stack trace output for normal logs\n- Or configure it to show only relevant application code stack frames (filtering out the logger's internal frames)\n- Consider implementing a custom LogPrinter that formats logs in a cleaner way, such as: \"11:47:07.970 [INFO] ErrorLogger initialized successfully\"\n- If stack traces are needed for debugging purposes, ensure they show the actual application code that called the logger, not the logger's internal implementation\n\nLook for configuration options like 'methodCount', 'stackTraceBeginIndex', or similar parameters in the PrettyPrinter class that control stack trace display behavior.\n</info added on 2025-05-17T10:02:07.684Z>",

Implement a conditional rendering mechanism that checks the wallet status before displaying zap icons\n4. Update the relevant components to use this conditional logic\n5.

Add granular logs around each phase of the join flow in `lib/provider/list_provider.dart` (before/after `_processJoinRequest`, on membership verification success/failure).\n   b. Temporarily surface logs in the UI (via `BotToast.showText`) or attach a debugger to pinpoint state lag or redundant dialogs.\n\n2. Refactor the Join API\n   a. Change `void joinGroup(...)` signature to `Future<bool> joinGroup(...)`, resolving only once membership is confirmed or failed.\n   b. Propagate the `bool` result through `_processJoinRequest` → `_handleJoinResults` so callers can await success status.\n\n3. Fix UI-side Logic\n   a. In `content_group_invite_widget.dart`, disable the “Join” button while awaiting, await `joinGroup(...)`'s bool return, show success toast only on `true`, and update `_joined` only on concrete success.\n   b. In `no_communities_widget.dart` and sheet, guard the “Join Test Users Group” action with `listProvider.isGroupMember(...)` to prevent redundant dialogs.\n\n4. Improve Group Info Loading\n   a. In the group-detail screen, inject a spinner (e.g. `CircularProgressIndicator`) while `GroupProvider.query(...)` fetches metadata/admins/members.\n   b. Ensure `_queryGroupMetadata(groupId)` is called immediately after join and triggers `notifyListeners()` for real-time UI updates.\n\n5. Consolidate State Management\n   a. Extract group-list mutations (`_addGroupIdentifier`, `_updateGroups`) into a single `joinComplete` path to avoid multiple `notifyListeners()` calls.\n   b. Replace fixed `Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3))` with a subscription to relay membership events for immediate updates upon confirmation.\n\n6. Robust Error & Edge-Case Handling\n   a. Show an inline error UI (e.g. `Text(\"Couldn’t join. Tap to retry\")`) on verification failures instead of only toasts.\n   b. Test under network throttling to ensure loading spinner and retry logic behave correctly.\n\n7. Automated & Manual Tests\n   a. Unit tests for `ListProvider.joinGroup` and `_verifyMembership`, mocking the Nostr client to simulate outcomes.\n   b. Widget tests for `content_group_invite_widget.dart` to verify button states and messaging.\n   c. End-to-end script covering new-user join flow to validate group appearance and metadata display.\n\n8. UX Polish\n   a. Replace “Joining…” toast with an inline spinner inside the ElevatedButton.\n   b. Auto-scroll/focus the newly joined group in the list post-join.\n   c. Consider caching group metadata locally for instant display on app relaunch.\n\n9. Roll-out & Verification\n   a. Deploy to internal QA for 2–3 teammates to test on various devices.\n   b. Collect feedback on any remaining delays or confusing messages and iterate.",

      "details": "1. Analyze the current codebase to identify all areas of excessive coupling, especially in main.dart, and document the current import, state, and routing patterns.\n2. Define clear feature modules with explicit boundaries, ensuring each module encapsulates its own views, view models, repositories, and services, following MVVM or a similar layered architecture as recommended by Flutter best practices[1][2].\n3. Design and implement a robust dependency injection system (e.g., using get_it or riverpod), replacing direct dependency access and singleton initializations with injected dependencies to improve testability and maintainability[1][2].\n4. Refactor the router architecture by extracting route definitions from main.dart and organizing them into dedicated routing modules, ensuring separation from application initialization logic.\n5. Break down global state and singleton objects into coherent, modular state management units, leveraging providers or other state management solutions declaratively rather than imperatively[1][2].\n6. Introduce barrel files (index.dart) for each module to aggregate exports and reduce import clutter throughout the codebase.\n7. Establish and document clear layering (data, domain, presentation) within each module, ensuring responsibilities are well-separated and interfaces are well-defined[1][2][4].\n8. Convert imperative provider initialization to a declarative approach, utilizing MultiProvider or similar patterns for cleaner and more maintainable state management.\n9. Throughout the refactoring, monitor and address any performance regressions, applying Flutter performance best practices as needed[5].\n10. Structure the plan for incremental implementation, prioritizing non-breaking changes and providing migration guidance for each step to ensure application stability.",
