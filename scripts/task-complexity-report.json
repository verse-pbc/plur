      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 10,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of post removal for organizers into backend API development, authorization logic, UI/UX for web and native apps, offline handling, notification/audit systems, security, documentation, and comprehensive testing across platforms.",
      "reasoning": "This task spans backend and frontend, requires secure role-based access, cross-platform UI, offline sync, audit logging, and must meet strict moderation and security requirements. It also involves extensive documentation and testing, making it highly complex and suitable for a large number of subtasks."
