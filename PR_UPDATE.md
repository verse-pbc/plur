# Combined Feed Feature PR Update

This PR has been expanded to include a new combined feed feature that allows users to view posts from all their joined communities in a single, unified feed view.

## New Features

1. **Tabbed Communities Interface**
   - Grid View: Shows communities in a grid layout (original view)
   - Feed View: New combined feed showing posts from all communities

2. **Combined Feed**
   - Displays posts from all joined communities in chronological order
   - Shows a count of the total number of communities
   - Handles new posts with a notification system
   - Responsive to communities being joined or left

3. **Improved UI**
   - Streamlined navigation with clear tab labels and icons
   - Reduced redundancy in UI text and buttons
   - Consistent visual design with the rest of the application

## Technical Implementation

1. **New Components**
   - GroupFeedProvider: Manages fetching and merging posts from multiple communities
   - AllGroupPostsWidget: Implements the tabbed interface
   - CommunitiesFeedWidget: Container for the combined feed
   - GroupEventListWidget: Displays the list of community posts
   - CommunityTitleWidget: Displays the feed title with community count

2. **Testing**
   - Added unit tests for the GroupFeedProvider
   - Tests cover initialization, event identification, and event merging

3. **Documentation**
   - Added detailed documentation in `/doc/features/combined_feed.md`
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md to include the new feature

## UI Improvements

1. Reduced redundancy by:
   - Changing "Your Groups" to simply "Communities" in the main app bar
   - Using "Grid View" and "Feed View" instead of repeating "Communities"
   - Removing the duplicate "Create Group" button

2. Added clearer visual indicators:
   - Grid and feed icons in tabs for easier identification
   - Community count badge in the feed title

## Screenshots

(Screenshots would be included in the actual PR)

## Next Steps

The combined feed feature is now complete and ready for review. Future enhancements could include:
- Sorting and filtering options
- Community-specific indicators on posts
- Read/unread status tracking

This feature builds upon the public community discovery feature by providing users with an easier way to stay updated with all their communities.
