# Code Quality and Localization Update for Calendar Feature

## Summary
This PR addresses code quality issues and fixes missing localization that was causing test failures. It improves type safety, error handling, and follows Flutter's latest best practices for color manipulation and context safety.

## Implements CHANGELOG Items

### From Internal Changes Section
- ✅ **"Fix localization issues in calendar events feature"**
- ✅ **"Improve code quality with context handling for BotToast messages"**
- ✅ **"Update deprecated color API usage throughout the app"**
- ✅ **"Enhance async error handling in UI components"**

## Technical Changes

### Localization Fixes
- Added missing 'refresh' string to localization resources
- Fixed missing string reference in the group_detail_events_widget.dart file
- Regenerated localization files with intl_utils
- Ensured all calendar event UI elements use proper localization

### BuildContext and Async Safety
- Added context.mounted checks before accessing BuildContext in async operations
- Fixed potential BuildContext usage errors in paste_join_link_button and editor_mixin
- Improved editor error handling to safely display errors only when context is valid
- Enhanced state management for async operations

### Color API Modernization
- Updated deprecated .withOpacity() usage to modern .withAlpha() for better precision
- Fixed color value retrieval with .toARGB32() instead of the deprecated .value getter
- Updated all core UI components including buttons, cards, and dialogs
- Ensured consistent use of theme colors throughout the app

### Code Quality Improvements
- Removed unused local variables across several components
- Eliminated unnecessary imports in multiple files
- Improved string concatenation with proper string interpolation
- Fixed an unnecessary Container nesting in event_top_widget.dart
- Updated test mocks to handle null safety properly

## Testing
- Fixed failing tests that were relying on missing localization strings
- Verified all our changes using the Flutter analyzer tool
- Fixed color-related deprecation warnings
- Ran and passed tests for group_feed_provider_test.dart, group_provider_test.dart, and group_metadata_repository_test.dart
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing code

## Benefits
- Improved type safety with nullable context handling
- Reduced deprecation warnings for Flutter 3.16+ compatibility
- Fixed test failures related to missing localization resources
- Better error handling with context verification
- Cleaner codebase with fewer unused variables and imports
- More efficient color handling with modern APIs

## Impact 
The changes primarily focus on code maintenance and quality. Users won't see visible differences, but the app will be more stable, especially when handling async operations. Tests will pass more reliably, and the codebase is now better prepared for future Flutter updates.
